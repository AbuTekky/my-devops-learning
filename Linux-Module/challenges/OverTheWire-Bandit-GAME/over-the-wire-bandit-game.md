##  My Journey with OverTheWire Bandit


As part of my journey to mastering Linux, I recently stumbled upon the **OverTheWire Bandit** game‚Äîand honestly, it‚Äôs been a game-changer for me. I chose Bandit because I wanted a fun, interactive way to apply my Linux skills in real-world scenarios, and it came highly recommended by the CoderCo team as a great starting point.

For those who haven‚Äôt heard of it, Bandit is a wargame that helps you sharpen your Linux command-line skills in a hands-on way. Each level throws a new challenge at you, pushing you to navigate directories, manipulate files, and use different commands to find hidden passwords and unlock the next level.

---

## üîç What I‚Äôve Learned So Far:

- **Mastering Commands:** Bandit has been a fantastic way to get hands-on with the command line. I started with the basics like `ls`, `cat`, and `grep`, and as I progressed, I got into more advanced tools like `find`, `xargs`, and `ssh`. It‚Äôs given me tons of practice, and I‚Äôve definitely sharpened my command-line skills.

- **Problem-Solving:** Every level in Bandit feels like solving a puzzle. You have to read carefully, think things through, and sometimes just try different approaches until something works. It‚Äôs really helped me become more methodical and patient when working through problems in Linux.

- **Scripting Practice:** Some levels push you to get creative by combining commands or even writing simple scripts. It‚Äôs been an awesome way to improve my scripting, something I wasn‚Äôt expecting to work on as much!

- **Security Awareness:** Along the way, Bandit throws in some important security concepts like file permissions and SSH. These things are critical, especially if you‚Äôre working in DevOps or managing servers. I picked up some useful security tips without even realizing it at first.

---

## ü§î Challenges Faced:

One of the toughest levels I tackled had me searching for a file with very specific properties using commands like `find ./inhere -type f -size 1033c` and `cat file.txt | sort | grep`. It took a while, and I struggled with it, but finally cracking it felt *so* satisfying. That‚Äôs what makes the challenge worth it.

---

## üí° Why I Think You Should Try It:

If you're looking to boost your Linux skills, I highly recommend giving OverTheWire Bandit a shot. It's tough, but that's what makes it rewarding. Each time you beat a level, it‚Äôs a big W, and it‚Äôs really satisfying to see how your skills improve as you go. Plus, there‚Äôs nothing quite like that feeling of finally cracking a tricky challenge.

##  Bandit Level 0


### Level Goal
The goal for **Bandit Level 0** was to log into the game server using SSH. My task was to connect to the provided host using the correct port, username, and password. Once I logged in, I needed to visit the Level 1 page to move on to the next step.

### What I Needed:
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** as my terminal.
- **SSH access to the server:**
  - Host: `bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
  - Port: `2220`
  - Username: `bandit0`
  - Password: `bandit0`

### Steps I Followed:
1. First, I opened my **WSL terminal**.

2. I used the following command to log into the Bandit server:
   ```bash
   ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

3. Here‚Äôs what each part of the command did:

    - ssh: started the secure connection.
    - bandit0 was the username I used to log in.
    - bandit.labs.overthewire.org was the remote server I needed to connect to.
    - -p 2220 specified that I used port 2220 instead of the default port.  

4. When prompted, I entered the password: bandit0.

5. Once I successfully logged in, I had completed Bandit Level 0.

##  Bandit Level 1 ‚Üí Level 2


## Level Goal
The password for **Bandit Level 2** was stored in a file called `-` located in my home directory. My task was to find and retrieve this password and use it to log into Bandit Level 2 via SSH.

## Steps I Followed:

1. **Navigated to My Home Directory**:
   - I made sure I was in my home directory, `/home/bandit1`. To do this, I used the command:
     ```bash
     cd /home/bandit1
     ```
   
2. **Listed All Files**:
   - Once in my home directory, I used the `ls` command to list all files, including hidden ones:
     ```bash
     ls -a
     ```
   - This command displayed the file I needed, which was named `-`. Since the file's name was a single dash, I had to handle it carefully, as the dash is normally interpreted as an option by most commands.

3. **Read the File's Contents**:
   - To read the contents of the file `-`, I used the following command to prevent the dash from being interpreted as an option:
     ```bash
     cat ./-
     ```
   - This command allowed me to successfully view the contents of the file, which contained the password for the next level.

4. **Logged into Bandit Level 2**:
   - After retrieving the password, I used it to log into **Bandit Level 2** with the following SSH command:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

## Commands I Used:
- `cd`: To ensure I was in the correct directory.
- `ls -a`: To list all files, including those with unusual names like `-`.
- `cat ./-`: To read the contents of the file named `-`.

## Notes:
- Handling files with unusual names like `-` required special attention. I used `./` before the file name to tell the system that I was referencing a file, not an option.
- I saved the password for **Bandit Level 2** in my notes to avoid repeating the process if I needed to revisit the challenge.

### Steps I Followed:

1. **Searched for the File Based on Properties**:
   - To locate the file that met all the specified conditions (owned by `bandit7`, group `bandit6`, and 33 bytes in size), I used the `find` command. This command searched the entire server:
     ```bash
     find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
     ```
   - The `-user bandit7` ensured the file was owned by the `bandit7` user.
   - The `-group bandit6` ensured it was owned by the `bandit6` group.
   - The `-size 33c` searched for files exactly 33 bytes in size.
   - The `2>/dev/null` redirected and suppressed any permission errors that appeared during the search.

2. **Identified the Correct File**:
   - The `find` command returned the file that matched all the conditions. I noted its location.

3. **Read the Contents of the File**:
   - After locating the file, I used the `cat` command to display its contents and retrieve the password for the next level:
     ```bash
     cat <filename>
     ```

4. **Logged into Bandit Level 7**:
   - After retrieving the password, I used it to log into **Bandit Level 7** with the following SSH command:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

### Commands I Used:
- `find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null`: To search for the file based on user, group, and file size while suppressing error messages.
- `cat <filename>`: To read the contents of the file and retrieve the password.

   - Since the password was the only line that appeared once, I knew I needed to group identical lines together. I sorted the lines using the `sort` command:
     ```bash
     sort data.txt
     ```
   - This ensured that all identical lines were adjacent to each other.

3. **Found the Unique Line**:
   - To identify the line that appeared only once, I piped the output of the `sort` command into `uniq -u`, which filtered the results to show only the lines that occurred once:
     ```bash
     sort data.txt | uniq -u
     ```
   - This command displayed a single line, which I knew was the password for the next level.

4. **Used the Password to Log into Bandit Level 9**:
   - After retrieving the unique line, I used it to log into **Bandit Level 9** via SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

### Commands I Used:
- `cat data.txt`: To view the contents of the file.
- `sort data.txt`: To sort the lines and group identical ones together.
- `uniq -u`: To filter and show only the lines that appeared once.
- `ssh`: To log into the next level using the password.

### Notes:
- Using `sort` and `uniq -u` together helped me quickly find the unique line in the file.
- I saved the password for **Bandit Level 9** in my notes to avoid repeating the process if needed.

## Bandit Level 9 ‚Üí Level 10


### Level Goal
The password for **Bandit Level 10** was stored in the file `data.txt` among a few human-readable strings, preceded by several `=` characters. My task was to extract the human-readable strings and locate the password.

### Steps I Followed:

1. **Extracted Human-Readable Strings**:
   - First, I used the `strings` command to extract all human-readable strings from the file `data.txt`. This command is useful for pulling out printable characters from a file that may contain binary data:
     ```bash
     strings data.txt
     ```

2. **Filtered for Lines with `=` Characters**:
   - Since the password was preceded by several `=` characters, I filtered the output of `strings` using `grep` to find only the lines that contained `=`:
     ```bash
     strings data.txt | grep '='
     ```
   - This command displayed several lines, and I focused on those with multiple `=` characters, as described in the level goal.

3. **Identified the Password**:
   - From the filtered lines, I found the line that matched the pattern. The string following the `=` characters was the password for the next level.

4. **Logged into Bandit Level 10**:
   - After retrieving the password, I used it to log into **Bandit Level 10** via SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

### Commands I Used:
- `strings data.txt`: To extract all human-readable strings from the file.
- `strings data.txt | grep '='`: To filter and find lines with `=` characters.
- `ssh`: To log into the next level using the password.

### Notes:
- The `strings` command helped me extract readable characters from a file that likely contained binary data.
- Using `grep` allowed me to efficiently narrow down the results to lines that matched the pattern described in the level goal.

## Bandit Level 10 ‚Üí Level 11


### Level Goal
The password for **Bandit Level 11** was stored in the file `data.txt`, which contained base64-encoded data. My task was to decode the base64 data and retrieve the password.

### Steps I Followed:

1. **Viewed the Contents of the File**:
   - First, I used the `cat` command to display the contents of `data.txt` and confirm that it contained base64-encoded data:
     ```bash
     cat data.txt
     ```

2. **Decoded the Base64 Data**:
   - Since the file was encoded in base64, I used the `base64 -d` command to decode it:
     ```bash
     base64 -d data.txt
     ```
   - This command transformed the base64-encoded data back into readable text, which included the password.

3. **Logged into Bandit Level 11**:
   - After retrieving the password, I used it to log into **Bandit Level 11** via SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

### Commands I Used:
- `cat data.txt`: To check the contents of the file.
- `base64 -d data.txt`: To decode the base64-encoded data and retrieve the password.
- `ssh`: To log into the next level using the password.

### Notes:
- The `base64 -d` command was the key to decoding the data and retrieving the password.
- I saved the password for **Bandit Level 11** in my notes to avoid repeating the process if needed.

##  Bandit Level 11 ‚Üí Level 12 

### Level Goal
The password for **Bandit Level 12** was stored in the file `data.txt`, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters had been rotated by 13 positions (ROT13). My task was to decode the ROT13-encoded data and retrieve the password.

### Steps I Followed:

1. **Viewed the File Contents**:
   - First, I used the `cat` command to check the contents of `data.txt` to verify that it was encoded using the ROT13 cipher:
     ```bash
     cat data.txt
     ```

2. **Decoded the ROT13 Data**:
   - Since all letters had been rotated by 13 positions, I used the `tr` (translate) command to shift the letters back to their original positions. I applied the following command to decode the ROT13:
     ```bash
     cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
     ```
   - This command translates the letters using the ROT13 algorithm, where each letter is replaced by the letter 13 positions before or after it in the alphabet.

3. **Identified the Password**:
   - After running the command, the decoded text was displayed, revealing the password for the next level.

4. **Logged into Bandit Level 12**:
   - I then used the password I retrieved to log into **Bandit Level 12** via SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

### Commands I Used:
- `cat data.txt`: To view the contents of the file.
- `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`: To decode the ROT13-encoded data.
- `ssh`: To log into the next level using the password.

### Notes:
- The `tr` command was perfect for decoding ROT13 since it allowed me to translate the alphabet by shifting each letter by 13 positions.
- I saved the password for **Bandit Level 12** in my notes to avoid repeating the process if needed.
