  My Journey with OverTheWire Bandit
</h2>


As part of my journey to mastering Linux, I recently stumbled upon the **OverTheWire Bandit** game—and honestly, it’s been a game-changer for me. I chose Bandit because I wanted a fun, interactive way to apply my Linux skills in real-world scenarios, and it came highly recommended by the CoderCo team as a great starting point.

For those who haven’t heard of it, Bandit is a wargame that helps you sharpen your Linux command-line skills in a hands-on way. Each level throws a new challenge at you, pushing you to navigate directories, manipulate files, and use different commands to find hidden passwords and unlock the next level.

## 🔍 What I’ve Learned So Far:

- **Mastering Commands**: From the basics like `ls`, `cat`, and `grep`, to more advanced commands like `find`, `xargs`, and `ssh`, Bandit has given me countless opportunities to practice and fine-tune my command-line abilities.
  
- **Problem-Solving**: Each level is like a puzzle. You need to carefully read, think critically, and sometimes experiment to figure things out. It’s really helped me become more methodical in tackling problems in Linux.

- **Scripting Practice**: Some levels require combining commands in creative ways or writing simple scripts. This has been a great way for me to improve my scripting skills.

- **Security Awareness**: Bandit also sneaks in some important security concepts, like file permissions and SSH. This has been super helpful, especially since these are things anyone working with Linux in DevOps or sysadmin roles should understand.

One of the trickiest levels I encountered involved searching for a file with specific properties using a combination of `find ./inhere -type f -size 1033c` and `cat file.txt | sort | grep`. I struggled with it for a while but finally managed to crack it! The sense of accomplishment after figuring it out was incredibly rewarding and made the challenge all the more worth it.

## 💡 Why I Think You Should Try It:

If you’re like me and want to deepen your understanding of Linux, **OverTheWire Bandit** is absolutely worth your time. It’s challenging, no doubt, but that’s what makes it so rewarding. Every level you beat is a small victory and proof that your skills are improving. Plus, there’s nothing quite like the satisfaction of cracking a tough level!

This experience has inspired me to continue exploring more advanced wargames like **Narnia** or **Leviathan**, to further strengthen my Linux and security knowledge. I highly recommend Bandit if you want to take your Linux skills to the next level—it’s one thing to read about commands in a book, but applying them in a real, game-like environment is where the real learning happens.

  Bandit Level 1 → Level 2
</h2>

## Level Goal
The password for **Bandit Level 2** was stored in a file called `-` located in my home directory. My task was to find and retrieve this password and use it to log into Bandit Level 2 via SSH.

## Steps I Followed:

1. **Navigated to My Home Directory**:
   - I made sure I was in my home directory, `/home/bandit1`. To do this, I used the command:
     ```bash
     cd /home/bandit1
     ```
   
2. **Listed All Files**:
   - Once in my home directory, I used the `ls` command to list all files, including hidden ones:
     ```bash
     ls -a
     ```
   - This command displayed the file I needed, which was named `-`. Since the file's name was a single dash, I had to handle it carefully, as the dash is normally interpreted as an option by most commands.

3. **Read the File's Contents**:
   - To read the contents of the file `-`, I used the following command to prevent the dash from being interpreted as an option:
     ```bash
     cat ./-
     ```
   - This command allowed me to successfully view the contents of the file, which contained the password for the next level.

4. **Logged into Bandit Level 2**:
   - After retrieving the password, I used it to log into **Bandit Level 2** with the following SSH command:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

## Commands I Used:
- `cd`: To ensure I was in the correct directory.
- `ls -a`: To list all files, including those with unusual names like `-`.
- `cat ./-`: To read the contents of the file named `-`.

## Notes:
- Handling files with unusual names like `-` required special attention. I used `./` before the file name to tell the system that I was referencing a file, not an option.
- I saved the password for **Bandit Level 2** in my notes to avoid repeating the process if I needed to revisit the challenge.

     sort data.txt
     ```
   - This ensured that all identical lines were adjacent to each other.

3. **Found the Unique Line**:
   - To identify the line that appeared only once, I piped the output of the `sort` command into `uniq -u`, which filtered the results to show only the lines that occurred once:
     ```bash
     sort data.txt | uniq -u
     ```
   - This command displayed a single line, which I knew was the password for the next level.

4. **Used the Password to Log into Bandit Level 9**:
   - After retrieving the unique line, I used it to log into **Bandit Level 9** via SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

### Commands I Used:
- `cat data.txt`: To view the contents of the file.
- `sort data.txt`: To sort the lines and group identical ones together.
- `uniq -u`: To filter and show only the lines that appeared once.
- `ssh`: To log into the next level using the password.

### Notes:
- Using `sort` and `uniq -u` together helped me quickly find the unique line in the file.
- I saved the password for **Bandit Level 9** in my notes to avoid repeating the process if needed.

### Level Goal
The password for **Bandit Level 10** was stored in the file `data.txt` among a few human-readable strings, preceded by several `=` characters. My task was to extract the human-readable strings and locate the password.

### Steps I Followed:

1. **Extracted Human-Readable Strings**:
   - First, I used the `strings` command to extract all human-readable strings from the file `data.txt`. This command is useful for pulling out printable characters from a file that may contain binary data:
     ```bash
     strings data.txt
     ```

2. **Filtered for Lines with `=` Characters**:
   - Since the password was preceded by several `=` characters, I filtered the output of `strings` using `grep` to find only the lines that contained `=`:
     ```bash
     strings data.txt | grep '='
     ```
   - This command displayed several lines, and I focused on those with multiple `=` characters, as described in the level goal.

3. **Identified the Password**:
   - From the filtered lines, I found the line that matched the pattern. The string following the `=` characters was the password for the next level.

4. **Logged into Bandit Level 10**:
   - After retrieving the password, I used it to log into **Bandit Level 10** via SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

### Commands I Used:
- `strings data.txt`: To extract all human-readable strings from the file.
- `strings data.txt | grep '='`: To filter and find lines with `=` characters.
- `ssh`: To log into the next level using the password.

### Notes:
- The `strings` command helped me extract readable characters from a file that likely contained binary data.
- Using `grep` allowed me to efficiently narrow down the results to lines that matched the pattern described in the level goal.

  Bandit Level 10 → Level 11
</h2>

### Level Goal
The password for **Bandit Level 11** was stored in the file `data.txt`, which contained base64-encoded data. My task was to decode the base64 data and retrieve the password.

### Steps I Followed:

1. **Viewed the Contents of the File**:
   - First, I used the `cat` command to display the contents of `data.txt` and confirm that it contained base64-encoded data:
     ```bash
     cat data.txt
     ```

2. **Decoded the Base64 Data**:
   - Since the file was encoded in base64, I used the `base64 -d` command to decode it:
     ```bash
     base64 -d data.txt
     ```
   - This command transformed the base64-encoded data back into readable text, which included the password.

3. **Logged into Bandit Level 11**:
   - After retrieving the password, I used it to log into **Bandit Level 11** via SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

### Commands I Used:
- `cat data.txt`: To check the contents of the file.
- `base64 -d data.txt`: To decode the base64-encoded data and retrieve the password.
- `ssh`: To log into the next level using the password.

### Notes:
- The `base64 -d` command was the key to decoding the data and retrieving the password.
- I saved the password for **Bandit Level 11** in my notes to avoid repeating the process if needed.

  Bandit Level 11 → Level 12 (bamboozled on this one...)
</h2>

### Level Goal
The password for **Bandit Level 12** was stored in the file `data.txt`, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters had been rotated by 13 positions (ROT13). My task was to decode the ROT13-encoded data and retrieve the password.

### Steps I Followed:

1. **Viewed the File Contents**:
   - First, I used the `cat` command to check the contents of `data.txt` to verify that it was encoded using the ROT13 cipher:
     ```bash
     cat data.txt
     ```

2. **Decoded the ROT13 Data**:
   - Since all letters had been rotated by 13 positions, I used the `tr` (translate) command to shift the letters back to their original positions. I applied the following command to decode the ROT13:
     ```bash
     cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
     ```
   - This command translates the letters using the ROT13 algorithm, where each letter is replaced by the letter 13 positions before or after it in the alphabet.

3. **Identified the Password**:
   - After running the command, the decoded text was displayed, revealing the password for the next level.

4. **Logged into Bandit Level 12**:
   - I then used the password I retrieved to log into **Bandit Level 12** via SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
     ```

### Commands I Used:
- `cat data.txt`: To view the contents of the file.
- `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`: To decode the ROT13-encoded data.
- `ssh`: To log into the next level using the password.

### Notes:
- The `tr` command was perfect for decoding ROT13 since it allowed me to translate the alphabet by shifting each letter by 13 positions.
- I saved the password for **Bandit Level 12** in my notes to avoid repeating the process if needed.
