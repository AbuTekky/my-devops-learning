## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system that is the backbone of many servers, networks, and cloud infrastructures. Unlike proprietary systems like Windows or macOS, Linux allows anyone to study, modify, and redistribute its source code.

## Setting Up Linux on Your Computer

You can use virtualization to run Linux/Ubuntu on your current operating system. **VirtualBox** is a free tool that allows you to do this.

### Benefits of Virtualization:
- Run Linux without replacing your current OS.
- Run multiple operating systems on a single machine.
- Isolate different systems while sharing resources.

## What Are Linux Distributions?

A Linux distribution (distro) is a version of Linux designed for different use cases. Think of Linux as the **engine** and distributions as the **vehicle**.

**Ubuntu** is one of the most beginner-friendly distributions.

## Linux Terminal

The terminal is a command-line interface (CLI) that lets you interact with your operating system by typing commands. It provides direct control of your OS.

Common tasks include:
- Navigating the file system.
- Installing and configuring software.
- Performing administrative tasks.

## Linux Shortcuts

- **Open terminal**: `Ctrl + Alt + T`
- **Increase text size**: `Ctrl + Shift + +`
- **Clear the screen**: `Ctrl + L`
- **Exit typing mode**: `Ctrl + D`

## File Permissions

Linux uses binary, octal, and string representation for file permissions.

Use the **CHMOD Calculator** built by CoderCo to calculate permissions:
